# Agent instructions

Rules for working in this repository. What each feature does is not described here: read
`docs/conditional-docs.md` and the docs whose line matches your task.

## Tooling

- Yarn only (4.6.0 Berry, pinned via `packageManager` and corepack). Never npm
  or npx; `yarn dlx` if a one-off binary is unavoidable.
- lefthook runs on every commit: Prettier on staged files (re-staged
  automatically), `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn knip`; and `yarn test`
  on every push. Hooks install through `postinstall` on `yarn install`. Do not
  bypass them.
- Conventional-commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). No
  trailers of any kind: no `Co-Authored-By`, no `Signed-off-by`.
- Default branch is `develop`.
- `next dev` in Next 16 wants to write its own `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
  That is switched off in `next.config.ts` (`agentRules: false`); these two
  files are maintained by hand. Still read the relevant guide under
  `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before Next.js work; the framework moves
  faster than training data.
- No em-dashes in any file. Use commas, periods, colons or parentheses.
- `.adw/project.md` is this repository's ADW profile; the toolkit's slash commands
  read it before anything else. When a change renames a script, moves a port,
  adds an env file or changes where docs live, update the profile in the same
  change, and never rename or reorder its nine `##` headings.

## Documentation

- One doc per feature in `app_docs/`, one line per doc in `docs/conditional-docs.md`.
  `README.md` is human-facing (what the app is, how to run it, links into the docs); this file
  holds rules only. Never describe a feature here or in `README.md`.
- Every "do not" and "never" in a feature doc's Rules section is an invariant, as binding as a
  rule in this file. A change that breaks one changes the rule in that doc in the same commit.
